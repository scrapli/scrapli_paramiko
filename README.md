scrapli_paramiko
================

This is the paramiko plugin for [scrapli](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli).

If you would like to use scrapli, but prefer to use paramiko as a driver for whatever reason (perhaps you are on
 Windows?), this is the library for you!
 
Please see the main [scrapli repo](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli) for much more information.
